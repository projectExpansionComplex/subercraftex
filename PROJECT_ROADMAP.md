# Subercraftex: The Official Project Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic, phased development plan to build and launch the `subercraftex` platform. Each phase represents a major milestone, building upon the last to ensure a robust, scalable, and feature-rich application.

--- 

### **Phase 0: Foundational Solidification & Backend Refinement**

**Goal:** Ensure the project's foundation is stable, secure, and ready for scalable development. We will transition from the existing Node.js monolith to the agreed-upon microservices architecture using our local environment.

*   [x] **Step 0.1: Finalize Core Database Schema:** (MongoDB model analysis complete, PostgreSQL schema designed and SQL generated)
    *   [x] Review all existing MongoDB models.
    *   [x] Design the definitive PostgreSQL schema based on the models, ensuring relational integrity for users, products, orders, and vendors.
    *   [x] Generate and save the SQL schema file.

*   [x] **Step 0.2: Refactor Backend into Core Microservices:**
    *   [x] **Auth Service (Go/NestJS):** Created and running locally, with passing e2e tests.
    *   [x] **User Service (Go/NestJS):** Created and running locally.
    *   [x] **Product Service (Go/NestJS):** Created and running locally.
    *   [x] **Order Service (Go/NestJS):** Created and running locally.

*   [x] **Step 0.3: Establish API Gateway:**
    *   [x] **Establish API Gateway:** Set up an API Gateway (using Go or NestJS) to be the single entry point for all frontend requests and implemented routing to the new microservices.
    *   [ ] Implement routing from the gateway to the new microservices.

*   **Step 0.4: Enhance Testing & CI:**
    *   [ ] Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all new microservices.
    *   [ ] Update the GitHub Actions CI pipeline to test each microservice independently.

### **Phase 1: The Core E-Commerce MVP**

**Goal:** Build the essential end-to-end user journey for a single customer to purchase a product. This phase focuses on frontend and backend integration.

*   **Step 1.1: User Authentication UI:**
    *   [ ] Build the React components for user registration and login pages.
    *   [ ] Integrate them with the `Auth Service` via the API Gateway.

*   **Step 1.2: Product Discovery UI:**
    *   [ ] Create a product listing page (Shop Page) with basic filtering.
    *   [ ] Build the product detail page.
    *   [ ] Integrate with the `Product Service`.

*   **Step 1.3: Shopping Cart & Checkout:**
    *   [ ] Implement the frontend for the shopping cart.
    *   [ ] Build the multi-step checkout form (shipping, payment).
    *   [ ] Integrate with the `Order Service`.

*   **Step 1.4: Payment Gateway Integration:**
    *   [ ] Integrate Stripe or PayPal into the `Order Service` to handle payments.

### **Phase 2: Multi-Vendor & Community Expansion**

**Goal:** Transform the platform from a single store into a true multi-vendor marketplace and community hub.

*   **Step 2.1: Vendor Onboarding & Dashboard:**
    *   [ ] Develop the UI for vendor registration.
    *   [ ] Build the vendor dashboard for managing products and viewing orders.
    *   [ ] Implement the necessary backend logic in the `User` and `Product` services.

*   **Step 2.2: Reviews & Ratings System:**
    *   [ ] Create a new **Review Service** to handle CRUD operations for product and vendor reviews.
    *   [ ] Build the frontend components for submitting and displaying reviews.

*   **Step 2.3: Community Features (Forums & Projects):**
    *   [ ] Create a new **Forum Service**.
    *   [ ] Build the UI for creating forum posts, categories, and replies.
    *   [ ] Implement the project showcase functionality.

### **Phase 3: Advanced Technology & AI Integration**

**Goal:** Introduce the high-tech features that will differentiate `subercraftex`.

*   **Step 3.1: AI Recommendation Engine:**
    *   [ ] Create the **AI Service (Python/FastAPI)**.
    *   [ ] Develop an initial product recommendation model (e.g., collaborative filtering).
    *   [ ] Expose recommendations via an API and integrate them into the frontend.

*   **Step 3.2: AI-Powered Search:**
    *   [ ] Integrate Elasticsearch with the `Product Service` for advanced text search.
    *   [ ] Enhance the AI service to provide personalized search results.

*   **Step 3.3: Virtual Showroom (Three.js):**
    *   [ ] Build the frontend components for the 3D virtual showroom.
    *   [ ] Create a new **Showroom Service** to manage showroom layouts and product placements.

### **Phase 4: Pre-Launch Hardening & Staging Deployment**

**Goal:** Prepare the application for a production launch by focusing on security, performance, and infrastructure.

*   **Step 4.1: Staging Environment Deployment:**
    *   [ ] Set up the staging VPS as per our plan.
    *   [ ] Deploy all microservices and the API gateway to the staging server using Docker.
    *   [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing.

*   **Step 4.2: Security Audit & Hardening:**
    *   [ ] Conduct a full security audit (check for XSS, SQL injection, etc.).
    *   [ ] Implement rate limiting on the API Gateway.
    *   [ ] Add comprehensive logging and monitoring to all services.

*   **Step 4.3: Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
    *   [ ] Write Terraform scripts to define the entire production AWS infrastructure (EKS, RDS, S3, etc.). This makes your infrastructure reproducible and version-controlled.

*   **Step 4.4: Load Testing:**
    *   [ ] Use a tool like k6 or JMeter to simulate heavy user traffic against the staging environment to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.

### **Phase 5: Production Launch & Iteration**

**Goal:** Go live and begin the cycle of monitoring, feedback, and improvement.

*   **Step 5.1: Production Deployment:**
    *   [ ] Use the Terraform scripts to create the production AWS environment.
    *   [ ] Deploy the application to AWS EKS.
    *   [ ] Migrate any necessary seed data to the production database.

*   **Step 5.2: Go-Live:**
    *   [ ] Point the domain DNS to the production application.
    *   [ ] Closely monitor application performance and logs.

*   **Step 5.3: Post-Launch Iteration:**
    *   [ ] Establish a process for gathering user feedback.
    *   [ ] Prioritize bug fixes and new features based on feedback.
    *   [ ] Continue to iterate and improve the platform.
